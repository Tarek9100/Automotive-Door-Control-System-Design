# Automotive-Door-Control-System-Design
In the automotive industry, ECUs are communicating together to provide safety and driver's comfort.

ECUs are microcontrollers connected with input and output devices, input devices to sense the surrounding environments, and output devices to perform actions according to readings that came from input devices.

For two ECUs communicating together to control car lights according to door state, light sitch state, and car speed state.

Static design analysis

For ECU 1:

Make the layered architecture Specify ECU components and modules Provide full detailed APIs for each module as well as a detailed description for the used typedefs

For ECU 2:

Make the layered architecture Specify ECU components and modules Provide full detailed APIs for each module as well as a detailed description

Dynamic design analysis

For ECU 1:

Draw a state machine diagram for each ECU component Draw a state machine diagram for the ECU operation Draw the sequence diagram for the ECU

For ECU 2:

Draw a state machine diagram for each ECU component Draw a state machine diagram for the ECU operation Draw the sequence diagram for the ECU
